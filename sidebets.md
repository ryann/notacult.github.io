# Sidebets

We often set out to form productive and healthy habits, only to fall short. There's different literature and science around exactly how long it takes to form a habit--21 days is thrown around a lot. It's probably close to correct.

21 days is exactly 3 weeks. 3 sets of 7 days. Why not make it easier and break it down into sets of 7 days? If that sounds scary, then how about doing one thing tomorrow? [Negotiate with yourself. Don't be tyrannical.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vk64cQmva0)

#### Pick a challenge, and a time period, and do it. Some examples of challenges:

 - Meditate at least once every day.
 - Run 15K in a week.
 - Do 100 push-ups every day.
 - Finish a book in a week.
 - Do a certain amount of focused productivity on a task. 

And hold yourself accountable. Get some skin in the game, raise the stakes. Make a **side bet**. Pick your "punishment". Or if that word is too harsh or negative for you, then how about thinking of it as a deposit on improving your life?

#### Some examples of deposits:

 - Money. Preferably in the form of cryptocurrency. Any meaningful amount that has a little sting.
 - Doing something embarrassing. Perhaps recording yourself singing a song.

### FAQ
Q: Where does the money go if I have to pay a monetary punishment?
A: For now, all cryptocurrency deposits go into a shared wallet. This wallet will be used to fund business ideas, fun activities, possibly steak a reward pool. The bottom line is the money will be used to benefit the group.
