# Absolutely not a cult.

[Who would ever sacrifice such a creature?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ2Dz0haLTg) Not us, I say.

## Code of Conduct
- No dick picks.
- Don't ask to ask, just ask.
- Have 5 ideas every monday for a standup (attendence not required) weekly scrum meeting. They can be anything for now.
- Clean your room and sort yourself out, bucko.
